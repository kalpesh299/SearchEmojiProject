# SearchEmojiProject
Created this project using vanila js just to leanr array methods like Fitler,Map etc

* A simple web application to search emojis as per our input, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- We can type any emoji name or expreation.
- Responsive design for desktop devices.
- Minimalistic and user-friendly interface.
- Responsiveness: While this static webpage doesn't currently employ media queries for responsiveness, it's an area I intend to explore in the future. Adding responsive features would make the page accessible on various devices, such as phones, tablets, and smaller screens.
